                  Bone Chilling causes all chill effects to give us Bone Chilling, increasing Frost damage we deal by 0.5% for 8 sec, stacking up to 10 times.</p>
              <p>
                  Lonely Winter removes the ability to use Summon Water Elemental. However, it increase the damage of Frostbolt, Ice Lance and Flurry by 25%.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Ice Nova causes a whirl of icy wind around the enemy, dealing Frost damage to the target and Frost damage to all other enemies within 8 yards, and freezing them in place for 2 sec.
              </p>
              <p class="BottomText">
                  Bone Chilling here is the default choice as it provide you with the most damage with Lonely Winter in a very close second. Ice Nova doesn't really deal enough damage for it to be used in this tier.

                  Glacial Insulation also increases your armour by 200% while Ice Barrier is active. Additionally, when Ice Block fades you instantly gain Ice Barrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shimmer is a talent that replaces Blink. It provides us with an additional charge, is not on global cooldown and also can be used while casting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ice Floes is a talent that allows your next spell to be cast while moving as long as the spell is shorter than 10 seconds, this effect has 3 chargers and you can cast it multiple times at once if a lot of movement is imminent
                </p>
                <p class="BottomText">
                  The default choice here is Shimmer. When used properly, it provides the best overall mobility and allows for higher dps uptime during an encounter. Ice Floes also has its place in raids when movement can be predicted and the extra Blink is not necessary. Unfortunately, Glacial Insulation gets little to no use inside raids as it simply doesn't compare to the other two talents in terms of power.

                    Incanter's Flow passively increases your damage done building up to 20% increased damage and then diminishing down to 4% increased damage, cycling every 10 sec.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mirror Image creates 3 copies of us nearby, which cast spells and attack your enemies lasting 40 seconds.

                  <p>
                    Rune of Power places a Rune of Power on the ground for 10 sec which increases your spell damage by 40% while we stand within 8 yds. Maximum of 2 charges.
                  </p>
                  <p class="BottomText">
                    Incanter's Flow is the best choice here because of how Frost damage is distributed. Frost has very consistent damage throughout the fight with smaller peaks during cooldowns in comparison to other specs. Rune of Power comes in at a close second, the difference between Rune of Power and Incanter's Flow is minimal Mirror Image is simply not as good as the other two and therefore doesn't see any play.

                      Frozen Touch increases your change to generate Fingers of Frost and Brain Freeze by 20% This effect is not additive, it is multiplicative. You do not add 20% to the base chance to generate Fingers of Frost and Brain Freeze, instead it is 20% of the base value of both Fingers of Frost (15%) and Brain Freeze (25%) making Fingers of Frost 3% and Brain Freeze a 5% increased chance to proc.

                    <p>
                      Ebonbolt is exactly the same as it was when we had your Artifact. You launch a bolt of ice at the enemy, dealing Frost damage and granting you Brain Freeze.
                    </p>
                    <p class="BottomText">
                      All 3 talents are close in damage, Chain Reaction seems to perform better when there are more targets where Ebonbolt and Frozen Touch perform better on a single or two targets.

                          Comet Storm Calls down a series of 7 icy comets on and around the target, that deals Frost damage to all enemies within 6 yds of its impacts.
                        </p>
                        <p class="BottomText">
                          Comet Storm is king on single target. Splitting Ice is the best two target talent and Freezing Rain becomes better when there are more targets. Because all three talents are very close in damage it is recommended that you sim yourself for this tier especially.

                            Glacial Spike conjures a massive spike of ice, and merges your current Icicles into it. It impales your target, dealing damage plus the damage stored in your Icicles, and freezes the target in place for 4 sec. Damage may interrupt the freeze effect. Requires 5 Icicles to cast. Note: Ice Lance no longer launches Icicles.
